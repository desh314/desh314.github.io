Hi Mridula/Maidan/Galti/Bestie/Girlie...!

In trying to find all the possible different nicknames I could come up 
with to make fun of you, I realized that it was practically impossible.
You are so many different things to me. You will always be one of my best 
friends, but also a person I can always depend on to make me smile, a person 
that I can text randomly and expect a response and most importantly, someone 
who I can without doubt say inspires me everyday.

I know the last few months have not been easy! But I just want 
you to know that I am really proud of you in every way imaginable!
One of the long friday calls we had, you asked me whether I read 
the letters you wrote me when I felt down. Its not just the letter but
reminiscing every experience we had togther always lightens my day 
and makes everyday that much easier. I will forever be grateful for 
every moment we spent together.

I added some videos below. I hope this can be something that you can look 
at when you feel down and feel the same way I do about the letters you wrote me.
Anywho, in a video, you ask me "will this place change". The more I reflect on it, 
the more I realized that despite physical distance and all the change in our lives, 
I am glad that you remained a constant. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that despite everything that happens
I hope that I can be someone who can witness the great things you will 
for sure accomplish in your life. 

The past summer was really fun and special and I hope we can
spend more time like that together! Dont take too much stress and
take care of your health! Also I really think you should start a 
youtube/mukbang channel. 

Cant wait to tease you in real life,

Anirdesh (Your second best friend)
